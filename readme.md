<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


You want your bitcoin wallet's public key to have some specific keywords? Lets say  1NsFwfz76nJR1ToweUTDTYDGYSnseNBB4w is your wallet address. Now isn't that cool? This application employs threaded approach to brute force to help find the address you desire. Depending on the length of your choice of word to the processing power of your device, it can take anywhere from few minutes to infinite time to get you what you want.

Here's why you'd want keyword in your address:
* to know which keys you used when and get an idea for how you want to utilize certain address
* To show off
* To maybe someday sell it to certain entities under certain agreement

Of course, it is rediculously hard to get what you are looking for and for an average name, you can expect atleast a month of runtime to get anything even close to what you are looking for. But you never know , it might be your lucky day. Feedbacks and donations are appretiated.
